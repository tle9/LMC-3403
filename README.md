## Class Objective:
- At Georgia Tech, the technical communication courses are multimodal. Tech comm builds on the competencies developed in English 1101 and 1102, with an emphasis on communicating in business, science, engineering, and other technical disciplines. Students learn to create workplace genresâ€”from traditional print documents such as correspondence, proposals, and reports to electronic forms such as emails, interactive maps, visualizations, websites, and social media. Students in technical communication learn to assess rhetorical situations underlying workplace genres as they discuss some of the theories and research that define technical communication as a discipline.
- Many instructors enrich the course with their nonacademic work experience from the corporate and nonprofit worlds as writers, editors, and communication specialists. Whatever their work experience, technical communication instructors challenge students to think about communication outside the bounds of the classroom. Some instructors build courses around final projects with workplace clients. Some require students to create and run mock companies. Others help students build online portfolios. Still others invite guest speakers from the corporate world. All instructors of tech comm teach the basic genres of workplace communication, information design, and professional etiquette necessary for students to succeed as professionals in their chosen fields. As with other Writing and Communication Program courses, tech comm instructors design courses that reflect their own scholarly interests while meeting Writing and Communication Program outcomes and guidelines related to assessment, textbooks, and other programmatic concerns.
## Background
- Technical communication is ever-changing as technology and media are constantly redefining the boundaries of what is possible and preferred. Accompanying this abundance of new resources (which allow communicators more exacting control over their work) is the sometimes overwhelming presence of micro-choices (I had over 5000 options in font alone for this
document, not including orientation, or color).
- Each choice is a decision in itself that affects the perception of the communication, the communicator, and the influence of the
communication on the audience. For this reason, communicators must be aware of the changing means and ends of designing visual messages and information.
- In this class, students will focus on choice curation across assignments such as instructional videos, qualitative research, and narrative-based instructional design
# Projects:
## Instructional Video
As a team, you will create an instructional video on one of the standards from your charter. This video must have informational instruction, appropriate examples, and some form of self-evaluation.
## Information Design Narrative
As a team, you will create an informational narrative designed to instruct your audience about some technical procedure/process. You will merge storytelling and information design to make procedural information better to understand. This narrative should use typical narrative structure and useful (not merely decorative) visual aids.
